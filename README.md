# E-commerce Front-End Static Page

## Description

This project is a static webpage of a font-end e-commerce website. This page is interactive, as you can select the images, sizes and color options.
This page is also mobile responsive, with just one singular media query. 

My motivation for building this project was to practice my front-end CSS skills. I really enjoy minimal design, therefore, I went for a design that was inspired by Urban Outfitters. I thought that Urban Outfittesr would be great for practice, as they're website is very clean and minimal. Therefore, I took the page as heavy inspiration and guidance when creating this webpage.
